    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a easy and simple recipe for you to make gyeran jjim (korean style steamed eggs).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>water or broth(anchovy broth is recommended)</li>
        <li>green onions</li>
        <li>sesame seeds and oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the eggs, water/broth, and salt until the whites and yolks are well combined. Optional: For a finer texture, you can strain the mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture into a small pot heated over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Using a spoon, mix the eggs while scraping the bottom and sides. You should start to see the mixture thicken up as the eggs cook.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are about 75% cooked, lower the heat and cover with a domed lid or a heat safe bowl to steam the eggs. Be sure there's enough room for the egg to expand as it steams. After 2 to 3 minutes, you should start to see steam escaping from the cover.</li>
        <li>Uncover and garnish with green onions, sesame seeds, sesame oil, and pepper. The steamed eggs should be light and fluffy. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
