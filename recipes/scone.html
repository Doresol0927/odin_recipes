    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a easy and simple recipe for you to make classic English scones.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>baking powder</li>
        <li>sugar</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>an egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab your food processor, add in the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. After combine them, add in the cubed butter and pulse a couple times. The mixture should look something like coarse sand.</li>
        <li>Transfer the coarse flour mixture to a large bowl and in a separate small bowl whisk the milk and egg together. Reserve about 2 tablespoons of this milk/egg mixture to use for a wash later on, then pour the remaining mixture into the bowl with the flour.</li>
        <li>Pour the dough out onto a floured surface then knead it a few times, just until it's smooth. Press the dough down into a circle that's about 1 inch thick. </li>
        <li>Using a 2Â½-inch cookie cutter or the floured rim of a glass, cut round scones out of the dough. Then place the rounds onto a piece of parchment paper, making sure that the scones are touching. Once you've cut all possible circles from the dough, reshape the scraps into a 1-inch thick circle once again and cut out more. </li>
        <li>Bake them for 13 to 15 minutes in your oven preheated to 425 F.</li>
        <li>Eat them with clotted cream and jam!</li>
    </ol>
